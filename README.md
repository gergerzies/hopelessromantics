Speech-to-Text
Python’s speechrecognition (sr) library which supports APIs for speech recognition eg. Google Web Speech API, which was used here.
Initialising a recogniser - creating an instance of the Recogniser class which is part of the sr library
Capture, process and convert (using the google API) audio

Python’s PyAudio library which handles audio input and output.
Provides access to computer’s mic to record audio needed for sr
Also can output audio but we’re not using that
